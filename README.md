# Deep Vision Processing
Deep computer-vision algorithms for [Processing](https://processing.org/).

### Idea
The idea behind this library is to provide a simple way to use (inference) neural networks for computer vision tasks inside Processing. Mainly portability and easy-to-use are the primary goals of this library. Because of that (and javacv), no GPU support at the moment. 

First of all a simple proof of concept will be created which implements the [YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) to define where to store the weight and model data and to specify the final API. (*This has already been done!*)

#### API Structure
The API should support the following (‚ú® = `implemented`):

- Support for model & weights fetching
    - Local sketch installation ‚ú®
    - Global library installation (not yet supported)
- YOLO
    - YOLOv3-tiny ‚ú®
    - YOLOv3-spp ([spatial pyramid pooling](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55014630/1138326)) ‚ú®
    - YOLOv3 (608) ‚ú®
    - ~~YOLO 9K~~ ([not supported by OpenCV](https://answers.opencv.org/question/180425/opencv-darknet-error-when-initializing-darknet/?answer=180441#post-id-180441))
- face detection
    - Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB RFB (~30 FPS on CPU) ‚ú®
    - Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB Slim (~40 FPS on CPU) ‚ú®
- openPose
    - Single Human Pose Detection based on lightweight openpose ‚ú®
    - Multi Human Pose Detection (currently struggling with the partial affinity fields ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è help?)
 - classification
    - MNIST CNN ‚ú®
    - FER+ Emotion ‚ú®
    - Age Net ‚ú®
    - Gender Net ‚ú®
- openVINO (support is on it's way [javacpp-presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/pull/820))
    - Lightweight OpenPose (Multi-Person)
    - Face Detection
    - Facial Landmark Detection
