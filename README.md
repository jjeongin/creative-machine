# Deep Vision Processing
Deep computer-vision algorithms for [Processing](https://processing.org/).

### Idea
The idea behind this library is to provide a simple way to use neural networks for computer vision tasks inside Processing.

First of all a simple proof of concept will be created which implements the [YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) to define where to store the weight and model data and to specify the final API.
